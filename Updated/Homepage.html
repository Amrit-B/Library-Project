<p  style="color:white; padding:10px; border:2px solid magenta; margin:20px;">A digital library, also called an online library, an internet library, a digital repository, or a digital collection is an online database of digital objects that can include text, 
still images, audio, video, digital documents, or other digital media formats or a library accessible through the internet. Objects can consist of digitized content like print or
 photographs, as well as originally produced digital content like word processor files or social media posts. In addition to storing content, digital libraries provide means for 
organizing, searching, and retrieving the content contained in the collection. Digital libraries can vary immensely in size and scope, and can be maintained by individuals or 
organizations.[1] The digital content may be
 stored locally, or accessed remotely via computer networks. These information retrieval systems are able to exchange information with each other through interoperability and
 sustainability
<br>
The Grainger Engineering Library Information Center provides computing facilities including:

Three computer and multi-media labs with over 100 engineering workstations, which are used for CAD, numerical analysis and modeling, and software development.
A digital imaging lab housing the Digital Library Initiative Projects, which provides access to 62,000 full-text journal articles; an information retrieval laboratory for visitors and
 researchers utilizing Grainger and campus resources.
Two instructional services labs, which serve as high-tech classrooms for information literacy instruction and presentations.
In addition, public-use terminals have been placed throughout the building that provide access to a statewide online catalog, Compendex, INSPEC, Aerospace Database, National Technical 
Information Service (NTIS), 1,000 full-text journals, and a wealth of local information resources.[8] With more than 1.5 million people using the building in 2000, it is currently the
 second most visited study area on campus, second only to the Illini Union.
